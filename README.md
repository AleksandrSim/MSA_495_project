# MSAI_495_project
In the following repo our team has constructed the Cycle Gan. The goal of the project is to make people look older and reverse the process, by de-aging people. We have used a [Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset](https://bcsiriuschen.github.io/CARC/) to accomplish this goal.

To identify the best archichture suitable for generating synthetic images, we constructed different classification models at first. The code for classification is presented in the [folder](https://github.com/AleksandrSim/MSA_495_project/tree/main/classification).


Once we have identified the architechture, we have created a Cycle Gan. The code for the Cycle Gan model and training can be found here [here](https://github.com/AleksandrSim/MSA_495_project/tree/main/gan_modeling)


We have achieved decent results. After 5 epochs of training we have achieved following *resuts*
